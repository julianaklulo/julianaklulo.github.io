<h3>About me</h3>
<p>For those who donâ€™t know me yet, nice to meet you! Iâ€™m Juliana Karoline (also known as <strong>@julianaklulo</strong> on the internet), and Iâ€™ll be sharing a summary of my journey in technology.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h4>How I discovered computing</h4>
<p>Since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve always been interested in computers, probably because of my dad, who was always fixing computers and video game consoles when I was little.</p>
<p>I got my first computer on my 7th birthday, and at 11 I took a professional IT course (the kind meant for people entering the job market). It was funny because I was much younger than everyone else in the class, but still really eager to learn everything.</p>
<p>I learned a lot, which helped me understand how computers work. The coolest part was the hardware module, where I learned to completely disassemble and reassemble a computer.</p>
<h4>High School and Technical Course</h4>
<p>It felt natural to choose a Technical Program in IT at the Technical School in my hometown (Franca/SP, Brazil), since I imagined it would be focused on hardware repair. But I was surprised to discover programming:
a concept I had never even thought about before. Learning to code changed my life, and it gave me the certainty that this was what I wanted to do for a living.</p>
<p>During the course, I spent a lot of time with classmates from the Mechatronics course, and that was when I discovered it was possible to combine hardware and software projects.
My final project focused on this: we built a circuit to trigger a siren, controlled by a Visual Basic application. Around that time, I discovered Arduino, which opened my mind to more complex microcontroller
projects (our final project only used a transistor switching a relay based on serial port input).</p>
<p>In high school, I visited the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos (UFSCar) on a field trip organized by school. That day, I met students from the Computer Engineering course who were showcasing lots of
robotics projects at their booth. I was very impressed, and at that moment I decided that this was the degree I wanted to pursue.</p>
<h4>University</h4>
<p>I studied Computer Engineering from 2014 to 2019. But even after 5 years in the course, I still had 50% left to complete because of one subject: Physics I.</p>
<p>I really struggled with physics, and failing it blocked the rest of the engineering curriculum, which depended heavily on physics as prerequisites for other key subjects.</p>
<p>It was really sad, but I decided to switch to Computer Science, which has the same computer classes but without the engineering specific subjects. I knew this would make it harder to work with hardware in the future, 
but Iâ€™d still be able to work in programming and continue my embedded systems projects as a hobby.</p>
<h4>Python</h4>
<p>While still in college, I co-founded PyLadies SÃ£o Carlos, one of the first PyLadies chapters in Brazil. I also co-founded grupy-sanca (SÃ£o Carlos Area Python User Group). Through Python, I discovered MicroPython, which became one of my greatest passions.</p>
<p>Being able to use the full power of Python on microcontrollers was the best of both worlds, since I could take everything I had learned from the Python community and apply it to embedded development.</p>
<h4>MicroPython</h4>
<p>My friends in the Python community encouraged me to share my projects at conferences. I gave my first talk at Python Brasil 2016, where I spoke about IoT development with Intel boards that, unfortunately, never ended up supporting MicroPython.</p>
<p>At Python Brasil 2019, I began my journey of promoting MicroPython, and since then Iâ€™ve been bringing projects to national and international conferences.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve had the honor of presenting MicroPython technical content twice at PyCon US, the largest Python conference in the world. And I continue to do my best to inspire more people to dive into this world!</p>
<h3>About this blog</h3>
<p>I plan to post content in both English and Portuguese whenever possible, since I give talks in both languages (available on the <strong>Talks and Tutorials</strong> page). Iâ€™d like to reach people who have seen my presentations in either language.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out to me about any of the posts published here. You can find me everywhere as <strong>@julianaklulo</strong>.</p>
<p>I hope this content is useful to you, and that it inspires you to create your own projects!</p>
