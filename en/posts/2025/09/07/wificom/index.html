<p><img src="../../../../../../images/wificom/DM20_VPet.png" width="200" height="300"></p>
<p>The idea was to build a <a href="https://wificom.dev">WifiCom</a>, which is a physical device that uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W and some electronic components
(OLED display, buttons, buzzer) to connect with the V-Pet in online applications such as <a href="https://w0rld.io">w0rld</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, I got super excited about building a WifiCom, since it would help me improve my circuit assembly skills, as well as 3D modeling for making the case.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h3>Assembly and setup</h3>
<p>The first step was assembling the circuit on a breadboard. On the WifiCom website, thereâ€™s the <a href="https://docs.wificom.dev/picow_breadboard/">circuit schematic</a> with several modules.
For the DM20, I only used the prongs module (the metal contacts at the top of the V-Pet used for communication). Assembly was pretty simple since the circuit isnâ€™t very complex.</p>
<p>After assembling the circuit, you need to configure the firmware on the board. First, I installed <a href="https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/bin/raspberry_pi_pico_w/en_US/adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico_w-en_US-9.2.8.uf2">CircuitPython 9.2.8</a>
on the Raspberry Pi Pico W. Then, I used the <a href="https://github.com/mechawrench/wificom-update-tool">wificom-update-tool</a> script to install the WifiCom firmware on the device.</p>
<p>The last step was editing the configuration file (<code>secrets.json</code>). This file contains the SSID and password for the WiFi network, as well as the WifiCom access keys (available on the dashboard after creating an account).</p>
<p>Time to test the circuit: I connected the jumpers to the V-Pet prongs, summoned my Agumon inside w0rld, and it worked!</p>

<h3>Planning the circuit board</h3>
<p>My plan was to transfer the circuit to a double-sided perfboard. It was my first time doing this, and I immediately realized how challenging it would be to fit all the components in a compact way.</p>
<p>I spent several days planning the circuit layout, sketching the traces and component placement on paper.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../../images/wificom/Desenho_Circuito.jpg" width="400" height="250"></p>
<p>Eventually, I gave up on squeezing everything together and decided to make a modular circuit: one board for the buttons and another for the prongs module. The other components would be fixed directly to the case.</p>
<p>I cut the board and soldered the components, trimming the wires to the exact length so everything would fit neatly. I tested the circuit, and everything worked perfectly.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../../images/wificom/Circuito_Modular.png" width="250" height="300"></p>
<h3>Designing the case</h3>
<p>Ever since I bought my 3D printer, my goal was to learn modeling with <a href="https://www.freecad.org/">FreeCAD</a>, and I had just started working on that.
This project was my first chance to put my new skills into practice.</p>
<p>I designed a two-piece case fastened with M3 screws. I cut openings for the OLED display, the LED, and the buttons, as well as the USB ports of the Raspberry Pi Pico W and the battery charging circuit.
I also added a power switch at the bottom and a slot for the prongs circuit at the top.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../../images/wificom/Case.png" width="600" height="250"></p>
<p>I didnâ€™t get the dimensions right on the first try, it took a few rounds of trial and error before I got the final piece. I ended up forgetting to add a hole for the V-Pet pin and had to make one manually.</p>
<h3>Final result</h3>
<p>With the circuit completed, the last step was deciding what to use for the prongs contact. My first attempt was using two screws, since I couldnâ€™t find
the nickel strip recommended by others who had built the project. After a lot of searching, I finally found it sold as 18650 battery welding strip.
It looked much better with the nickel strip.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../../images/wificom/Prongs.png" width="600" height="250"></p>
<p>Finally, the WifiCom alongside the V-Pet. The size turned out similar, making it easy to connect the two.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../../images/wificom/Resultado_Final.jpg" width="350" height="350"></p>
<p>This was one of the most complete projects Iâ€™ve ever done, since it involved everything from building the circuit to designing the case. Iâ€™m really happy with the result!</p>
